# Overtime Income calculator using React-Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Objective

The project aims to act as a calculator for the overtime income of a person per week. This is achieved with the use of:
- Node.js
- React.js
- Redux
- Google Material UI (MUI)
- FastAPI

### Challenges and Opportunities

While the development of the React application was rather simple, its integration with redux state containers and subsequent shift from CSS to google MUI turned out to be the only real challenges. While figuring out how the storage and procedure of these storage containers did take time, it was not too long (a day) before I could implement the redux logic. The entire conversion and revamp to MUI did end up making the UI less appealing but whatever possible was salvaged.

Most of the issues encountered were simply resolved by the use of beautiful redux and MUI documentation and some Youtube videos. I look forward to implementing MUI better in my future projects.

## How to Use

The usage of this project is very simple. Just enter your base weekly overtime income and pick a range of hours from the drop-down menu. Click on the '$' button below to generate the result.

### To run locally:
#### Terminal 1
npm start
#### Terminal 2 (cd backend)
venv\scripts\activate (if venv is created)
uvicorn main:app --reload

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
